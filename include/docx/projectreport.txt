Project Report: Simple Traffic Violation & Penalty Management
Date: 25 November 2025
Author: Navjyot Singh (project adapted for beginner demonstration)

1. Project Overview
-------------------
This small C project demonstrates a simple Traffic Violation & Penalty Management system. It is written in a beginner-friendly style (suitable for a 1st-semester B.Tech student) and uses in-memory arrays for core data structures so the code is easy to read and extend.

2. Purpose
----------
- To demonstrate basic C programming concepts: structs, arrays, functions, file organization, and simple I/O.
- To provide a starting template for learning how to build a small console application in C.

3. Main Features
-----------------
- Add and list vehicles (in-memory storage).
- Record violations and list violations (in-memory).
- Mark violations as paid (updates in-memory state).
- Basic reports: counts of violations and pending payments.
- Very small and readable codebase with clear separation of headers and source files.

4. Project Structure
--------------------
- `include/` - header files (`vehicle.h`, `violation.h`, `reports.h`, `penalty.h`).
- `src/` - source files (`main.c`, `vehicle.c`, `voilation.c`, `reports.c`, `penalty.c`). Note: `voilation.c` filename is intentionally left as-is (typo) to avoid breaking references.
- `README.md` - build/run instructions and notes.

5. Build Instructions
---------------------
From the project root run:

```
gcc -I include -o program src/*.c
```

This creates an executable named `program` in the project root.

6. Run Instructions
-------------------
Run the program:

```
./program
```

To automatically exit (quick check):

```
printf "0\n" | ./program
```

7. Limitations (Current Minimal Version)
---------------------------------------
- Most data is stored only in memory; the application does not persist vehicles or violations between runs.
- Some modules have simplified logic or stubbed behavior to keep the code small and easy to understand.
- A few filenames contain typos (for example, `voilation.c`) — these were intentionally left unchanged.

8. Future Improvements (Suggested)
---------------------------------
- Add simple file-based persistence (save/load vehicles and violations from text files).
- Fix file name typos and update includes accordingly.
- Add input validation and clearer error handling.
- Add a `Makefile` and small unit tests for key functions.
- Improve report generation (sort, filter, aggregate amounts by date).

9. Testing and Validation
-------------------------
- After building, run basic manual flows: add vehicles, record violations, list violations, mark payments, and run reports.
- For automated checks, add a few unit tests or small scripts that call the binary with predefined inputs.

10. Notes for Instructor / Maintainer
------------------------------------
- The code is intentionally simplistic for pedagogical use. When extending it for production-like usage, introduce proper file locking, input sanitation, and possibly move to a small embedded database or structured text files.

If you want, I can now:
- Implement file-based persistence for vehicles and violations, or
- Rename `voilation.c` to `violation.c` and update includes, or
- Add a `Makefile` and example data files.
