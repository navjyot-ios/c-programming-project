Project Report: Simple Traffic Violation & Penalty Management System
================================================================

1. Project Title
----------------
Simple Traffic Violation & Penalty Management System (Beginner Version)

2. Abstract
-----------
This small C project demonstrates a basic command-line system for managing vehicle
records, recording traffic violations, marking payments, and generating simple
reports. The code is intentionally simple and implemented using in-memory data
structures so it is easy to read and understand for a first-semester B.Tech
student.

3. Objectives
-------------
- Provide an interactive menu-driven CLI in C.
- Allow adding and listing vehicles.
- Allow recording violations and marking them as paid.
- Provide a minimal reporting capability (counts and simple aggregates).
- Keep code simple, readable, and easy to extend.

4. Tools and Environment
------------------------
- Programming language: ANSI C (gcc)
- Development environment: macOS / Linux terminal
- Build command used:
	gcc -I include -o program src/*.c

5. Project Structure
--------------------
Root folder layout (important files):

- include/
	- vehicle.h      -- vehicle structures and prototypes
	- violation.h    -- violation structures and prototypes
	- reports.h      -- report prototypes
	- penalty.h      -- penalty prototype (kept minimal)

- src/
	- main.c         -- simple menu and controller
	- vehicle.c      -- in-memory vehicle functions (add, list, search)
	- voilation.c    -- in-memory violation functions (record, list, pay)
	- reports.c      -- small reports (counts and file-based summaries if files exist)
	- penalty.c      -- minimal/placeholder (payment logic in violation module)

- docx/
	- projectreport.txt  -- this report file

- README.md        -- build/run instructions and notes

6. Design & Implementation Details
----------------------------------
- main.c
	- Presents a simple menu to the user.
	- Calls functions from other modules to perform requested actions.

- vehicle.c
	- Uses a small in-memory array `Vehicle vehicles[50]` to store added
		vehicles during program execution. Functions:
		- `add_vehicle()` : prompts and stores a vehicle record.
		- `list_vehicles()` : displays all stored vehicles.
		- `search_vehicle()` : checks whether a reg. no. exists in memory.

- voilation.c (note filename kept as-is)
	- Uses an in-memory array `Violation viols[MAX_VIOLS]` to store violations.
	- Functions:
		- `record_violation()` : prompts for reg no and type, assigns id and fine.
		- `list_violations()` : shows all recorded violations and payment status.
		- `mark_violation_paid()` : marks a violation paid by ID.
		- `violation_count()`, `pending_count()` : utility counters used by reports.

- reports.c
	- Simple routines for reporting. In this beginner version, reports use
		the in-memory counters; if payment or violations text files are present,
		some functions also read them for examples.

- penalty.c
	- Kept minimal to avoid duplicate symbols; main payment logic is in
		`voilation.c` for this simplified build.

7. How to Build and Run
-----------------------
Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
gcc -I include -o program src/*.c
```

Run the program:

```bash
./program
```

To auto-run a quick command (exit immediately):

```bash
printf "0\n" | ./program
```

8. Sample Interaction
---------------------
When you run the program you will see a simple numbered menu. Examples:

- Add Vehicle (enter reg no, owner, type)
- List Vehicles (shows reg, owner, type)
- Record Violation (enter reg, type; violation ID shown)
- List Violations (shows id, vehicle, type, fine, paid)
- Pay Violation (enter id to mark paid)

9. Limitations (current beginner-level choices)
----------------------------------------------
- All data is stored in memory while the program runs. When the program
	exits, stored vehicles and violations are lost.
- There is minimal input validation and no concurrency handling.
- Some file-based code was simplified or removed to keep the project easy to read.

10. Suggested Next Steps / Improvements
-------------------------------------
- Add simple text-file persistence: save `vehicles.txt` and `violations.txt` on
	every change and load them at program start.
- Fix file name spellings (`voilation.c` -> `violation.c`) and update includes.
- Add a `Makefile` to simplify builds and a `clean` target.
- Add basic unit tests or small example input files for quick demos.
- Improve input validation and error messages.

11. Author / Contributors
------------------------
Project adapted for beginner learning and readability. Prepared in this
workspace and simplified to help a first-semester student understand
core concepts: program flow, arrays, structs, and basic file I/O (optional).

12. Contact / Next Actions
--------------------------
If you want persistence added, file rename corrections, or a `Makefile`, tell
me which of these you'd like next and I will implement it.
